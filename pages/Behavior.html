	After hearing the story about how Maslow trained his dog, I always tried to condition my behavior. For example, I am not a fan of vacuuming the house. I try to watch a tv show that I like right before and right after vacuuming. This way, when I look at the vacuum, I think about watching my favorite tv show and not about a dull task. I apply this process to work projects, eating better, and working out. I have to admit this does not always work, but it never makes it worse.

	Most people that meet me tend to be come happier. I am the kind of person that has a bright outlook to life. I am in a career that I like. My career is not the easiest or one that pays a lot. Nonetheless, I enjoy it. My career lets me get improve my own skill set, and help others improve their skill set. I am around people all day, and I get holidays and summers off. I get to see the results of my work right away, and I make a positive long-term impact on my students.
