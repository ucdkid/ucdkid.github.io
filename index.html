	     Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do. My name is Allen, and yes I enjoy sleeping. I especially like to sleep in. I like staying up at night and watch late night shows like "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert". Then sleeping in the next morning.

	     I was born in North Brunswick, New Jersey, but I grew up in the bay area.  I went UC Davis for my undergrad where I majored in Statistics and had a focus in Economics.  I finished my undergrad 2010, which was one of the hardest times to get a job. I spent a year looking for a job in my field, while working at a supply store, and as a math tutor. I got to interview at many companies like Sysco. I had seven back-to-back interviews with Sysco, but in the end they went with people who had more experience.

	     After that year I decide to follow another path, teaching. I went to CSU East Bay, for my teaching credential.  For the past three years I was a math teacher. A job where I do not get to do my favorite activity five days a week. A job where I would wake up at 4:30 am, review my notes, and drive for half an hour or longer to get to work. A job where I have to wait till the weekend to sleep in. I enjoy teaching. I enjoy make lessons where my students want to come to class. I enjoy seeing my student learn a new topic each day, and then saying, "this is easy." I just wish the school day would start later in the day so I would get to sleep in.

	     This year I am taking a break from teaching to complete my Masters in Education. As a kid I always thought my teachers knew everything. While I taught, a lot of my students would tell me that I was really smart. I like to think that I am a good teacher, and each year I try to get better. I also try to do my favorite activity as much as I can. I do not know what will happen in the future, but I look forward to working with all of you, and hopefully sleeping in.
