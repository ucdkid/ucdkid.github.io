	Diet for me is a goal. I know that I should aim to follow the chart on the left, but lifeâ€™s challenges do not always let you do this. Sometimes a person needs to work long ours, take out is the only way they can do all the work and eat. Sometimes a person is a guest and needs to eat what the host has. Sometimes you just want pizza. I try to eat right, but if life gets in the way I just go with it.
	</p>

	That being said, my favorite food is pizza. Not the healthiest food, but one I still eat once a month. I eat fruits like apples and bananas as snacks. I eat carats and lettuce as snacks. My next favorite food is steak. I tend to eat this twice a month. Other foods I tend to eat randomly through the month. I try to eat three times a day. No sugary foods after 6pm. I know that I do not have the best diet, but it works for me, and as time goes I try to improve.
