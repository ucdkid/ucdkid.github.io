	When I was born in a suburb of New Jersey. My grandparent had an apartment in New York City, and a cabin in the Catskills. These three locations were very different. I liked living close to my friends and being able to play with them near my home. Those are some benefits of living in the suburbs as a kid. Driving to my grandparents place in the city was amazing. Buildings were taller than you could see and look astonishing. There were landmarks and museums everywhere. During the summer, I would go to my grand parents cabin the hills. Their place was next to a farm and amazing walking trails. I could be around animals or go sight seeing. Luckily for my all three places were driving distances of each other. I never got sick of any of these locations.

	When I was ten my parents moved the family to the bay area. Our place was in Foster City, another suburb. Foster City was in the middle of three major cities, San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland. Foster City is also close to farmland near San Jose or camping are like Lake Tahoe. I got to enjoy all the habitats that I enjoyed as a little kid, but now on the west coast.  Also the weather here is amazing. I enjoy living in such a diverse place, that now that Iâ€™m an adult I choose to live in the bay area.
